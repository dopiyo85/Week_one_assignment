        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Diana Opiyo, I am from Gwassi, Suba. I studied IT at the United
          States International University - Africa. My concentration was networking.
          I am currently working at Safaricom PLC as Customer Experience Executive. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I graduated from university in 2008, that is about 12 years ago.
         I have really not gotten an opportunity to work as an IT specialist.
         I want to advance my career in IT, I am therefore attending this class to gain more knowlegde 
         in programming to be in a better position to advance my career.
